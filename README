Crunchsar is a perl script that takes the output from "sar -a" on a Solaris host and strips out "interesting" data into 
.csv files, useful for working in excel.

It's gone through multiple revisions and used to be called sarcrunch, but was renamed to make the use of shell globbing easier.

At present it's smart enough to read the server name, dates, and times out of the file and populate the hashes appropriately.
